# Double Standard Exposure

A methodology for revealing how identical actions receive different treatment based on who performs them. This skill makes visible the unequal application of rules, judgments, and consequences that maintain unfair systems.

## When to Use
- When the same action is praised in one group and condemned in another
- When rules are selectively enforced based on identity or position
- When language shifts to describe the same behavior depending on the actor
- When "exceptions" reveal the actual operating rules
- When fairness is claimed but not practiced
- When challenging systems that benefit from inconsistency



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Core Methodology

### Step 1: Identify the Behavior in Question

Define the action or pattern clearly:
- What is the specific behavior being judged?
- Strip away context to see the action itself
- Make sure you're comparing equivalent actions, not superficially similar ones
- Be precise enough that the comparison holds

### Step 2: Document the Different Treatments

Gather evidence of inconsistent response:
- What happens when Group A does this? What language is used?
- What happens when Group B does the same? How is it described differently?
- What consequences follow in each case?
- What justifications are offered for the differential treatment?

### Step 3: Present the Parallel

Create the direct comparison:
- Place the two treatments side by side
- Use parallel structure: "When X does it, it's called... When Y does it, it's called..."
- Let the contrast speak for itself
- Remove editorializing - the gap is the argument

### Step 4: Name the Operative Rule

Reveal what the actual standard is:
- If different treatment is the practice, what's the real rule?
- "The rule isn't X, the rule is X for some people"
- Show that the stated principle is not the operating principle
- Make the hidden standard visible

### Step 5: Demand Consistency

Force a choice:
- Either apply the same standard to both, or
- Admit the standard was never about the stated principle
- Ask which they prefer: universal application or honest acknowledgment?
- The discomfort of this choice is productive

## Examples of Application

### Workplace Context

**Stated rule:** "We value assertive leadership."
**Group A (majority):** Praised for "decisive action" and "strong presence"
**Group B (minority):** Criticized for being "aggressive" and "difficult"
**Exposure:** "If assertiveness is valued, it's valued in all assertive people. If it's only valued in some, the actual value is something else entirely."

### Political Context

**Stated principle:** "We condemn violence."
**When state does it:** "Maintaining order," "law enforcement," "necessary force"
**When protestors do it:** "Violence," "rioting," "terrorism"
**Exposure:** "The question isn't whether violence is wrong - it's why the same word disappears when the actor changes."

### Economic Context

**Stated principle:** "Personal responsibility for financial decisions."
**Individuals in debt:** "Should have been more responsible," face bankruptcy consequences
**Corporations in debt:** "Too big to fail," receive bailouts
**Exposure:** "Personal responsibility appears to have a minimum net worth requirement."

### Media Context

**Stated standard:** "Objective reporting on civil unrest."
**Domestic protests:** "Riots," "chaos," emphasis on property damage
**Foreign protests against adversary regimes:** "Pro-democracy movement," "freedom fighters"
**Exposure:** "The difference in coverage isn't about the events - it's about whose side we're on."

## Key Principles

1. **Inconsistency reveals actual values** - What people do differently shows what they actually believe, not what they claim

2. **Use their own logic** - The most powerful exposure uses the stated principles against the practice

3. **Precision matters** - Weak parallels can be dismissed; strong parallels cannot be ignored

4. **The gap is the argument** - You don't need to editorialize when the contrast is clear

5. **Demand resolution** - The discomfort of obvious inconsistency creates pressure for change or honest acknowledgment

## Calibration Notes

This skill requires intellectual honesty. Not all differential treatment is a double standard - sometimes context legitimately differs. The skill is powerful precisely because it identifies cases where context does NOT explain the difference.

Before claiming a double standard, verify:
- Are the actions genuinely equivalent?
- Are there legitimate contextual differences?
- Would a neutral observer see the parallel?

False equivalencies undermine the credibility needed to expose real double standards. Use this skill carefully and it becomes undeniable. Use it carelessly and it becomes dismissible.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology
